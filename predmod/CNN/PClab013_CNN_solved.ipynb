        "\n",
        "Convolutional neural networks caused a major step forward in the performance of computer vision. They first became popular because of an annual challenge in image classification: The [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet#History_of_the_ImageNet_challenge), where models were challenged to classify an image as belonging to one of a thousand(!) different classes. Until 2011, hand-crafted features on images in combination with more traditional machine learning methods such as SVMs reigned supreme. The best models using such techniques classified image wrongly about 26\\% of the time. In 2012, a breakthrough was made in terms of performance due to the succesful training of a large-scale CNN. Although the concept of convolutions has been known for quite some decades in machine learning, the technology for large-scale training of CNNs did not take off until this time because it was difficult to train them efficiently (GPU usage was not popular, and no solid platforms for computation on GPUs had been developed). Since then, the field has taken off and multiple developments have come yearly. In 2015, human performance in image classification on this dataset had been beaten by a 152-layer CNN model.\n",

In the case of image inputs, the tokens are pixels, and its input dimensionality is three (every pixel is defined by its red/green/blue values). The kernel, although often depicted as only evaluating one channel, actually takes **the sum of all channels** to obtain an output. If we only apply one kernel, we effectively compress the information in our image (since the RGB value of the pixel now has to be represented by a single number). For this reason, multiple parallel kernels are used that each output their own channel. Because of this, we can **learn higher-dimensional spaces of local regions of pixels**. The following image shows the difference between a convolution with one output channel and a convolution with 8 output channels. (The pictured convolution employs no padding, hence the width and height of the image are also affected)\n",

For this purpose, we can generate some random data in the same size as the MNIST data. Remember that MNIST consists of grayscale images, so they only have one input channel, as opposed to RGB images. They also have a 28 x 28 resolution:"
